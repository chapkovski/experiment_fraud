    <p>
        Now we are explaining you the detailed instructions for the first part of the experiment. The first part
        consists of 5 rounds.
        <br/>
        At the beginning of the first part you will be randomly and anonymously assigned to groups composed by 11
        individuals each. The group composition will remain the same for all the 5 rounds of the first part of the
        experiment. You will never know the identity of the other members of your group, nor during the experiment, nor
        at the end of it.
    </p>


    <p>
        Within each group composed by 11 participants, there will be the ALPHA party, composed by 4 individuals, and a
        Candidate A; the party BETA, composed by 5 individuals, and a candidate B.
        <br/>
        The role of Candidate A and Candidate B are randomly assigned at the beginning of the first part and will
        remain the same for all the 5 rounds of the first part;
        <br/>
        The role of party member of Party ALPHA and of Party BETA will be randomly assigned at the beginning of each
        round and thus might be different from round to round.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of each round you will be informed about which party you are randomly assigned to or whether
        you are randomly assigned the role of Candidate A or Candidate B.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moreover, to each member of Party ALPHA and of Party BETA it will be also randomly assigned a bonus Y. We will
        explain what this means in a moment.
    </p>

    <p>
        After that, each member of Party ALPHA and of Party BETA will be asked to choose one option out of two: option
        “VOTE” or option “ABSENTION”. In order to make a choice you just have to select one of the two options and click
        on the “OK” button on your screen, as shown in the following screenshot:
    </p>

    <p>
        After every party member has made a choice between voting or abstaining, the earnings for each member of Party
        ALPHA and Party BETA, as well as the earnings for Candidate A and Candidate B will be shown on the screen.
    </p>
    {% if session.config.info and session.config.fraud %}
        <p>
            However, before each member of party ALPHA and BETA decides to vote or to abstain, both candidate A and
            candidate B have the opportunity to subtract a vote to the other party so to add it to their own party. The
            cost of electoral fraud is randomly selected so that it may vary from round to round. The cost of electoral
            fraud is the same for candidate A and for candidate B and it might be equal either to 20 points or to 40
            points. In each period, all party members and candidates will be informed about the cost of electoral
            fraud.
        </p>

        <p>Let’s make some examples:</p>
        <p> Suppose that candidate A decides to implement electoral fraud so to subtract a vote to party BETA in order
            to add it to party ALPHA. Differently, candidate B decides not to implement electoral fraud.
            <br/>
            -If party BETA has at least one member who decides to vote then this vote will be automatically subtracted
            from party BETA and added to party ALPHA
            <br/>
            - If no member of party BETA decides to vote then a vote will be automatically added to party ALPHA while
            for party BETA nothing changes.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose that both candidate A and candidate B decide to implement electoral fraud. In this case nothing
            changes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once both candidate A and candidate B have decided whether to implement electoral fraud or not and they’ve
            been mutually informed about it, each candidate decides which of the following messages to send to all
            members of both Party Alpha and Party BETA.
        </p>

        <p>One of the following messages is chosen by candidate A:
            <br/>
            - Candidate B decided to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party ALPHA.
            <br/>
            - Candidate B decided NOT to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party ALPHA
            <br/>
            - Nothing to communicate</p>

        <p>One of the following messages is chosen by candidate B
            <br/>
            - Candidate A decided to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party BETA
            <br/>
            - Candidate A decided NOT to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party BETA
            <br/>
            - Nothing to communicate</p>


        <p>
            Finally, after all members of Party ALPHA and BETA have received both the message of Candidate A and of
            Candidate B, every party member will made a choice between voting or abstaining. The earnings for each
            member of Party ALPHA and Party BETA, as well the earnings for Candidate A and Candidate B will be then
            showed on the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
            Members of party ALPHA and of party BETA will never been informed, both during the experiment or after it,
            about whether candidate A or candidate B actually decided to implement electoral fraud or not.
        </p>


    {% elif session.config.fraud %}
        <p>However, before the ALPHA and BETA party members decide whether to vote or abstain, candidate A and candidate
            B have the option of subtracting a vote from the other party and adding it to their own party. The cost of
            this operation is the same for both candidate A and candidate B, it varies from period to period and can be
            20 points or 40 points, and in each period all participants will be informed of its amount.</p>
        <p>Let us take an example:</p>
        <p> Suppose that candidate A decides to implement electoral fraud so to subtract a vote to party BETA in order
            to add it to party ALPHA. Differently, candidate B decides not to implement electoral fraud.
            <br/>
            -If party BETA has at least one member who decides to vote then this vote will be automatically subtracted
            from party BETA and added to party ALPHA
            <br/>
            - If no member of party BETA decides to vote then a vote will be automatically added to party ALPHA while
            for party BETA nothing changes.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>Suppose both candidate A and candidate B have decided to subtract a vote from the other party, in this case
            there will be no change in the vote count for the two parties.</p>
        <p>Once both candidate A and candidate B have decided whether to implement electoral fraud or not and they’ve
            been mutually been informed about it, every party member will made a choice between voting or abstaining.
            Members of party ALPHA and of party BETA will never been informed, both during the experiment or after it,
            about whether candidate A or candidate B actually decided to implement electoral fraud or not.
        </p>

        <p>Finally, the earnings for each member of Party ALPHA and Party BETA, as well the earnings for Candidate A and
            Candidate B will be shown on the screen.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <p>
            After every party member has made a choice between voting or abstaining, the earnings for each member of
            Party ALPHA and Party BETA, as well as the earnings for Candidate A and Candidate B will be shown on the
            screen.
