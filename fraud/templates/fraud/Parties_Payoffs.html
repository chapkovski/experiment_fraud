        <strong>Earnings of members of party A and of party B </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Suppose you choose to vote:
        <br/>
        - If your party has more votes than the other party, then you will earn 105 points;
        <br/>
        - If both parties have the same number of votes than the other party then you will earn 55 points;
        <br/>
        - If, instead, the other party has more votes than your party, then you will earn 5 points;
    </p>

    <p>
        Alternatively, suppose you choose to abstain:
        <br/>
        - If your party has more votes than the other party, then you will earn 105 points plus your Y bonus;
        <br/>
        - If both parties have the same number of votes than the other party then you will earn 55 points plus your Y
        bonus;
        <br/>
        - If, instead, the other party has more votes than your party, then you will earn 5 points plus your Y bonus;
    </p>

    <p>
        The amount of your Y-bonus is assigned randomly by the computer and is shown on your screen. In any given round
        you have an equal chance of being assigned any Y-bonus between 0 and 55 points. Your Y-bonus in each round does
        not depend on your Y-bonus or decisions in previous rounds, or on the Y-bonuses and decisions of other
        participants.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since Y-bonuses are assigned separately for each participant, different participants will typically have
        different Y-bonuses. While you are told your own Y-bonus, you are never told the Y-bonuses of other
        participants. You only know that each of the other participants has a Y-bonus that is some number between 0 and
        55.
