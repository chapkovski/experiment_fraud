    Once both candidate A and candidate B have decided whether to implement electoral fraud or not and
    theyâ€™ve been mutually informed about it, each candidate decides which of the following messages to send to
    all members of both Party Alpha and Party BETA.
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    One of the following messages is chosen by candidate A:
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Candidate B decided to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party ALPHA.
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Candidate B decided NOT to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party ALPHA
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Nothing to communicate

</li>
<li class="list-group-item">One of the following messages is chosen by candidate B
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Candidate A decided to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party BETA
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Candidate A decided NOT to implement electoral fraud so to subtract one vote from Party BETA
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    - Nothing to communicate
</li>
<li class="list-group-item">
    Finally, after all members of Party ALPHA and BETA have received both the message of Candidate A and
    of Candidate B, every party member will made a choice between voting or abstaining. The earnings for
    each member of Party ALPHA and Party BETA, as well the earnings for Candidate A and Candidate B will be
    then showed on the screen.

<li class="list-group-item">
    Members of party ALPHA and of party BETA will never been informed, both during the experiment or
    after it, about whether candidate A or candidate B actually decided to implement electoral fraud or not.
